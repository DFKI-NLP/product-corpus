<TEXT>Curiosity Digs Deep, Grabs First Sample of Subsurface Mars The shakedown is over. Curiosity this month has drilled into the surface of Mars and taken the first sample any rover has ever retrieved from beneath the planet's surface, a place where evidence of a once-wet Mars still could endure. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Today <NODE id="338" />NASA<NODE id="342" /> announced that its Curiosity Rover has successfully collected the first sample drilled from the interior of a Martian rock and stands ready to perform the first analysis of material taken from beneath the surface of Mars. The rover spent the past month exploring Yellowknife Bay , an area hypothesized to have once been water-rich. Curiosity conducted preliminary drill tests , and eventually its first full-fledged drilling of Martian bedrock . Scott McCloskey, drill systems engineer for the Mars Science Laboratory , confirmed at a press conference today that the rover now holds about a tablespoon of gray, powdered rock drilled out from a section of Martian bedrock. Last week, using a complex combination of algorithms, <NODE id="1069" />contact sensors<NODE id="1084" />, and <NODE id="1090" />stabilizers<NODE id="1101" />, <NODE id="1103" />JPL<NODE id="1106" /> engineers and scientists instructed Curiosity to bore a 2.5-inch-deep hole into a portion of bedrock with the rover's heavy-duty <NODE id="1236" />rotary-percussion drill<NODE id="1259" />. It created a pile of grey-colored tailings which could potentially provide scientists with a window into the Red Planet's past. Curiosity's first drill hole at the John Klein site is a historic moment for the MSL mission, for <NODE id="1487" />JPL<NODE id="1490" />, <NODE id="1492" />NASA<NODE id="1496" />, and the United States, said Louise Jandura, sample system chief engineer, at today's press conference. While past missions-such as the manned Apollo landings in the 60s and 70s and the Soviet Union's Venera landers in the '80s-have bored into rock formations on the Moon and Venus, Curiosity is the first mission to drill down into the martian surface. Past martian rovers Phoenix, Spirit, and Opportunity had only <NODE id="1913" />rock-abrasion tools<NODE id="1932" />, which only scratched the surface of rocks on Mars. Having a rock-drilling capability on a rover is a significant advancement in our ability to investigate Mars, Janudra said. It allows us to go beyond the surface layer, unlocking a time capsule of evidence about the state of Mars going back three or four billion years. Joel Hurowitz, sampling system scientist, says that unlike surface samples, rock interiors haven't been exposed to the harsh radiation and weathering that could have destroyed the evidence of Mars' aqueous past. The difference is evident in the stark contrast of color between the red-orange surface-level rock and the grey tailings unearthed by rover's <NODE id="2609" />drill<NODE id="2614" />, Hurowitz says. This is something the science team is really excited about, he says. When things turns orange, there's a rusting process going on that oxidizes the iron in the rock, so the fact that these rocks aren't that color may be telling us that these rocks didn't go through that process that usually turns things to rust. In terms of the overall Curiosity mission, the drilling and collection of sub-surface samples was the last shakedown test for the rover, capping off a series of tests meant to ensure all of Curiosity's onboard equipment survived the landing and is functioning properly. It's a real big turning point for us, says John Grotzinger, the mission's principal investigator. With that comes more confidence, a chance at fewer surprises, and an increase in the efficiency of which we'll be able to do all of this. These celebrations, however, come with some complications. Daniel Limoadi, lead systems engineer for surface sampling and science systems, warned of a potential problem with a loose <NODE id="3633" />sieve<NODE id="3638" /> on the rover's <NODE id="3654" />Collection and Handling for In-Situ Martian Rock Analysis (CHIMRA) device<NODE id="3727" />. Based on <NODE id="3738" />JPL<NODE id="3741" /> tests here on Earth, the <NODE id="3767" />150-micron screen<NODE id="3784" /> responsible for sieving samples for the rover's <NODE id="3833" />Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin)<NODE id="3866" /> and <NODE id="3871" />Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instruments<NODE id="3912" /> came loose on one of two <NODE id="3938" />CHIMRA test devices<NODE id="3957" /> at <NODE id="3961" />JPL<NODE id="3964" />'s lab. While the damaged <NODE id="3990" />sieve<NODE id="3995" /> of the test model has proven to perform well into the rover's projected mission timeline and then some, scientists plan to reduce the amount of times they'll use the <NODE id="4162" />sieve<NODE id="4167" /> until they determine the cause of the test-model failure. In the next few days, scientists plan to sieve subsequent samples drilled from the same hole and then feed them into CheMin and then SAM. We're going to take it one step at a time, Grotzinger says. And based on that we're going to decide what to do next. The only thing I can say is we're discovery-driven. What do you think? More From Space
