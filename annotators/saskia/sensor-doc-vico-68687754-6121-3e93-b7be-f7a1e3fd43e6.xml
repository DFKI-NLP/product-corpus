<TEXT>59 Global Photoresists and Photoresist Ancillaries Market is Expected to Reach US$ 4.60 Bn in 2020 Photoresists Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2014 – 2020 Photoresists are light-sensitive materials that are primarily used in fabrication and packaging of semiconductors, integrated circuits, flat panel displays and printed circuit boards. Photoresists play an important role in photolithography and photo-patterning process. Photoresists consist of resin or polymer, solvent and photo-sensitizer. These are segmented into positive and negative photoresists based on developing option. Photoresists are applied on the surface of a wafer and further exposed to light of pre-determined wavelength. Photoresist ancillaries are supporting materials that are used to improve the efficiency and resolution of the photolithography process. These are used right from the start of the process such as adhesion promotion of photoresists to wafer substrate in order to develop photoresists to remove excessive photoresists after the developer treatment.
