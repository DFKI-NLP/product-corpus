(720) 410-5050 The detection of water and water damage in most locations can only be found with advanced <NODE id="1685" />dampness detection sensors<NODE id="1711" /> that can show us a picture of what is inside the walls. Once they are discovered proper water restoration processes must be applied by restoration companies. Water and flood damage is harmful to both home and health, it is also one of the worst things for organic materials including metal. Water is a very effective way of nature returning things back into the ground, and very few things escape this. It causes the growth of organisms such as black mold, and mildew which eats almost everything from <NODE id="2214" />clothes<NODE id="2221" />, <NODE id="2223" />furniture<NODE id="2232" />, drywall and wood or metal in your home. It also wreaks havoc on your immune system as I discovered when I was a healthy 32 year old. So it is very important health wise and home wise to remain dry. The mold spores continue to grow and spread when it is wet or dry. This is why it is a long term health problem, especially for the young, the elderly and when people are sick. It’s definitely not something you want in your home continuously sending itself through the air in your home.  For Thornton area residents undetected moisture under floors, <NODE id="2782" />carpets<NODE id="2789" />, behind walls or a wet basement will continue to cause harm until it’s remedied. These spores will also float into the air for years causing terrible odors, more mold colonizations and long term health issues. Greater damages will surface with time as products deteriorate, delaminate, shrink, split, etc, and escalating the damagers until very costly repairs are called for. The longer the water remains the more severe and costly the damages.
