The main points of focus are on the type approval process and on-going testing of cars already on the road. The executive body for the <NODE id="476" />European Union<NODE id="490" /> (<NODE id="492" />EU<NODE id="494" />) wants <NODE id="502" />vehicle<NODE id="509" /> testing to be carried out by independent assessors and for there to be a greater level of EU-level checks in the type approval process. The <NODE id="650" />EC<NODE id="652" /> also wants to reduce the financial connection between type approval regulators and the <NODE id="740" />vehicle<NODE id="747" /> manufacturers to prevent a conflict of interest occurring. Currently assessors test <NODE id="832" />vehicles<NODE id="840" /> at a national level and, once a type approval certificate has been awarded to a model, that is then valid in all <NODE id="954" />EU<NODE id="956" /> member states. This cross-border approval will remain, being tied into the <NODE id="1032" />EU<NODE id="1034" /> single market system, but there will be greater regulation from a European level. New plans would also allow member states to carry out spot-checks on <NODE id="1186" />cars<NODE id="1190" /> already on the market, with proposals for strict and quickly-implemented measures should <NODE id="1280" />vehicles<NODE id="1288" /> be found to be non-compliant. This on-going checking process will help the authorities prevent the late discovery of systems such as <NODE id="1422" />VW<NODE id="1424" />'s<NODE id="1426" /> '<NODE id="1428" />defeat device<NODE id="1441" />', that turned on <NODE id="1459" />emissions control systems<NODE id="1484" /> when it detected the <NODE id="1506" />car<NODE id="1509" /> being tested. Linked to this is the <NODE id="1546" />EC<NODE id="1548" />'s desire to order recalls at a European level and to impose heavy fines on manufacturers that allow illegal <NODE id="1657" />vehicles<NODE id="1665" /> to be sold. The proposals are planned to coincide with the implementation of Real-World Driving Emissions (RDE) testing and tighter NOx emissions levels which could still be months or years away. A recent plan to introduce stricter NOx limits was successfully fought by <NODE id="1936" />EU<NODE id="1938" /> Member States with large automotive manufacturing industries for example, and there is still the issue of how the type approval testing process will be funded if there is a break with manufacturer's payments. Independent environmental transport campaigners <NODE id="2196" />Transport and Environment<NODE id="2221" />'s (<NODE id="2225" />T&amp;E<NODE id="2228" />) clean vehicles director, Greg Archer, commented: This good proposal addresses many flaws in the current car testing system but lacks teeth. The principal reason why <NODE id="2395" />Volkswagen<NODE id="2405" /> managed to get away with cheating in Europe was the lack of independence of national authorities, which were compromised by their cosy relationship with <NODE id="2559" />car<NODE id="2562" /> makers. Without the threat of future <NODE id="2600" />EU<NODE id="2602" /> sanctions, it will be mission impossible to break the strong bond between national regulators and their <NODE id="2707" />car<NODE id="2710" /> makers that has protected the industry but at the cost of higher emissions. Dr Ben Lane. Director of <NODE id="2812" />Next Green Car<NODE id="2826" /> added: The tightening up of the relationships between testing agencies and manufacturers is to be welcomed as is the introduction of emissions checks on real <NODE id="2985" />vehicles<NODE id="2993" /> being used on real roads. In partnership with <NODE id="3040" />NXP Semiconductors<NODE id="3058" />, <NODE id="3060" />Next Green Car<NODE id="3074" /> is investigating how these spot-checks could be conducted at low cost on large numbers of <NODE id="3165" />vehicles<NODE id="3173" /> using Continuous Vehicle Emissions Monitoring (CVEM) , which utilises existing <NODE id="3253" />On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) sensors<NODE id="3286" /> to monitor emissions, and export this data to a central off-board server for reporting purposes. We are currently looking for an opportunity to trial this technology on an existing fleet to demonstrate to regulators that the rise of the <NODE id="3524" />connected car<NODE id="3537" /> will offer new ways to monitor and enforce future <NODE id="3588" />vehicle<NODE id="3595" /> emissions regulations.
