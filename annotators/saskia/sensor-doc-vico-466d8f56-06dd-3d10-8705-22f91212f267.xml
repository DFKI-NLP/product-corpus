<TEXT>Future Market Insights Impact of Existing and Emerging Electronic Toll Collection Market - Trends and Forecast Future Market Insights has announced the addition of the Electronic Toll Collection Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment 2014 - 2020 report to their offering. Valley Cottage, NY -- ( SBWIRE ) -- 02/10/2016 -- <NODE id="343" />Electronic toll collection system<NODE id="376" /> is an automated system, eliminating manual operations by toll payers and receivers. The global ETC market is expected to steer towards a strong double-digit growth rate in the coming five years (2015-2020). The primary drivers of the upcoming growth comprise the need to save travel time, cashless travel facility, the need to stop/minimize the traffic congestion and fast toll transaction. However, factors like high installation cost and a high dependence on government are hindering the growth of this market to some extent. The ETC market is expected to continue its rapid expansion to meet the surging demand for an improved, safe and secure infrastructure. The <NODE id="1044" />ETC system<NODE id="1054" /> provides fast, efficient and cost-effective services. They have easy to operate buttons with a user-friendly design. They are also beneficial for traffic agencies and companies as these systems eliminate the need for multiple toll plazas, acting as a cost-saving factor for road operator agencies. <NODE id="1353" />Electronic toll collection systems<NODE id="1387" /> have a positive impact on the environment as it reduces the amount of exhaust emitted from vehicles during start-up and stop at manual <NODE id="1523" />toll booths<NODE id="1534" />. The ETC market can be categorised into products, technologies, applications and geographies. <NODE id="1629" />Transponders<NODE id="1641" />, <NODE id="1643" />antennae<NODE id="1651" />, <NODE id="1653" />communication systems<NODE id="1674" />, <NODE id="1676" />treadles<NODE id="1684" />, <NODE id="1686" />inductive loops<NODE id="1701" />, <NODE id="1703" />scanning devices<NODE id="1719" />, <NODE id="1721" />weigh-in-motion devices<NODE id="1744" />, <NODE id="1746" />cameras<NODE id="1753" /> and <NODE id="1758" />film storage devices<NODE id="1778" /> are some of the major products of the system. An <NODE id="1828" />electronic toll collection system<NODE id="1861" /> consists of various subsystems, such as automatic vehicle identification (AVI), automatic vehicle classification (AVC), back-office &amp;integration and violation enforcement system (VES). These subsystems are useful for specific functions -AVI for vehicle identification, AVC for vehicle classification, toll collection transaction by integrating the back-office and payment system and VES to reduce unpaid tolls, by vehicle imaging. Request Free Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-76 On the basis of technologies, the ETC market can be segmented into various categories, such as radio-frequency identification (RFID), dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), video analytics, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS).Currently RFID and DSRC are the leading technologies. On the other hand, the GNSS and GPS are expected to show a high growth rate in following five years (2015-2020). Based on applications, the ETC market can be categorized into segments like highway, urban and bridges. Undoubtedly, ETC systems have been installed majorly on highways, but installation in urban areas and on bridges has a bright future opportunity. Geographically, the ETC market can be segmented into North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Japan, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Middle East &amp; Africa. Present market scenario represents a strong presence of <NODE id="3291" />ETC system<NODE id="3301" /> in the US, Canada and Mexico in North America, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Philippines and Singapore in Asia Pacific, and the UK, Ireland, Portugal, France, Germany, Italy and Spain in Europe.
