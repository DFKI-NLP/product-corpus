<TEXT>Press Releases Global Photonic IC Market - Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth and Forecast 2022 : Acute Market Photonic IC Market India, 28 January 2016 -- Acute Market Reports has Added latest Report on Global Photonic IC Market Size, share,Strategies And Forecasts in their Market Research Reports in database. Photonic integrated circuit is a equipment that combines numerous photonic operations into a single optical package. Unlike electronic integrated circuits that makes use of electrons as information carriers and photonic integrated circuits make use of photons. Since photons travel with the same speed as the speed with which light travels and so they are able to transfer information at greater speed than speed of electrons. Enhanced demand for high data speed and communication ability, generally in applications of data centers have resulted in significant growth of the photonic IC market globally. The global photonic IC market sector was evaluated at 191 million US dollars in year 2013 and is predicted to touch the revenue of 1300 million US dollars by the end of year 2022 growing at a CAGR rate of 26% during the forecasted period. Browse Full Report With TOC @ http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/photonic-ic-market-size The global photonic IC market is emerging at an exceptional rate as it offers significant enhancements in energy consumption, system size, costs and reliability. The growth and expansion of the silicon photonics technique has helped in large scale production of photonic integrated circuits at lesser costs. Also substantial advantages provided by photonic integrated circuits in terms of efficacy, speed transfer ,volume, transmission capability, use of power and costs is predicted to enhance and increase their acceptance as well as market penetration across different end use business verticals like telecommunications, healthcare, metrology, aerospace, data communications, industrial and defense. However, the packaging threats as well as the issues of design related with the photonic integration and lack of digitization have to some extent inhibited the extensive acceptance of photonic integrated circuits. But the utilization of photons to provide high speed data or information transfer and data processing for purpose of computations offers a good business avenue for the growth and expansion of the photonic IC market globally. Also commercial utilization of quantum computing is projected to provide business growth avenues for the global photonic IC market. The global photonic IC market is bifurcated into different market sections based on types, parts, raw materials, applications and geographical locations. Depending upon the integrated types, the universal photonic IC market is divided into hybrid integration, monolithic integration and module integration. Hybrid integration was the key integration method utilized for photonic integration and contributing about 57% to the total market revenue share in year 2013. Method of Monolithic integration is predicted to display optimum growth during the projected period. Based on the parts , the global photonic IC market is divided into detectors, lasers, optical amplifiers, modulators, attenuators, de-multiplexers and multiplexers. Among different photonic integrated circuit parts, lasers contributed to major portion of the revenue share of about 29% to worldwide photonic IC market in year 2013. Optical amplifiers helping in realization of high level photonic amalgamation by recompensing for visual losses from individual photonic elements is predicted to display optimum market growth during the forecasted period. Based on the raw materials the global photonic IC market sector is bifurcated into silicon, indium phosphide, lithium niobate, silicon on insulator, gallium arsenide and others that comprise of silicon nitride, silica on silicon and silicon dioxide. Silicon on insulator and insulin phosphide together contributed to about more than 61% of the universal market revenue share in year 2013. The domination of indium phosphide is generally due to its capability to combine opto electronic operations into an optical system chip monolithically. Further, the advantages provided in terms of energy efficacy, volume, momentum, packaging and fabrication cost has further strengthened its position as a market leader. Depending upon the applications the global photonic IC market is bifurcated into biophotonics, optical communications, optical signal processing and sensing. Biophotonics application is further divided into optical biosensors, medical instrumentations, analytics, diagnostics and photonic lab on a chip application. Optical communications is also bifurcated into optical datacom, fittx &amp; access networks, RF photonics, long haul networks and transport networks. Optical signal processing application comprises of various applications like quantum optics, optical metrology, quantum computing and optical instrumentation. Also sensing application includes chemical sensors, medicine, energy, utilities, structural engineering, aerospace sector and transport industry. Optical communications was the biggest application section in the global photonic IC market contributing for more than 59% of the total market revenue share in year 2013. It is predicted to remain the biggest application section during the forecasted period as a result of growing demand from data center uses and applications. Today, biophotonics and sensing are the other key application sections jointly contributing for about 36% of the total revenue of the worldwide photonic IC market. Though the recent contribution from the optical signal processing section is minimum, it is predicted to observe healthy growth after quantum computing services are available at commercial costs or business rates. Based on the geographical locations , the global photonic IC market is divided into sub continent of North America, continent of Europe, APAC region and region of rest of the world that includes middle east region, region of Latin America and African zone. Browse All Reports of This Category @ http://www.acutemarketreports.com/category/ict-market Sub continent of North America was the biggest global photonic IC market contributing about 38.56% of the total market revenue share in year 2013. It was followed by continent of Europe and APAC zone. During the predicted period, it is projected to remain the leading market section due to high level of penetration of photonic integrated circuit based equipments in the area of fiber optic communications, generally data center uses and applications. APAC region is predicted to observe rapid expansion during the forecasted period surpassing sub continent of North America and continent of Europe. This growth can be primarily credited to enhanced demand from biophotonics uses &amp; applications and data center.
