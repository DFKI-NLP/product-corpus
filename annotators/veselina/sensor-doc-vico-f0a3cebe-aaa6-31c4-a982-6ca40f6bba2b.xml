<TEXT>Full Description Lam Research Corporation (Lam Research), incorporated on September 8, 1989, is a supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. The Company's customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a range of electronics, including cell phones, computers, tablets, storage devices and networking equipment. The Company maintains a network of facilities throughout Asia, Europe, and the United States. The Company designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing systems that are used in the fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs). The Company operates in seven geographic regions: the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and Southeast Asia. The Company's customer base includes semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) that make products, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM), NAND memory, and logic devices. Semiconductor manufacturing, its customers' business, involves the fabrication of multiple die or ICs on a wafer. The Company's products are used primarily in front-end wafer processing, which involves the steps that create the active components of a device (transistor, capacitor) and their wiring (interconnect). The Company also addresses processes for back-end wafer-level packaging (WLP), which is an alternative to traditional wire bonding. In addition, its products are offered for related markets that rely on semiconductor processes and require production-proven manufacturing capability, such as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). The Company's thin film deposition systems form a device's sub-microscopic layers of conducting (metal) or insulating (dielectric) materials. The Company is a provider of plasma etch, a process step that selectively removes materials from the wafer to create the features and patterns of a device. The Company's wet spin clean and plasma-based bevel clean products remove particles, residues and film from the wafer surface before or after adjacent processes. Thin Film Deposition The Company offers thin film depositions for Copper Metal Films, including the SABRE Product Family; Tungsten Metal Films, consisting of ALTUS Product Family; plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) dielectric Films, including VECTOR Product Family; Gapfill Dielectric Films, such as SPEED Product Family, and Film Treatment, including SOLA Product Family. The SABRE electrochemical deposition (ECD) product family consists of a platform for copper damascene manufacturing. Its system capabilities include deposition of copper directly on various liner materials. The number of yielding ICs per wafer is optimized by increasing the usable die area through process edge exclusion engineering. The SABRE ECD product family's applications include copper deposition for both logic and memory interconnect. It also offers the SABRE third dimension (3D) system to address through-silicon via (TSV) and wafer-level packaging (WLP), applications, such as copper pillar, redistribution layer (RDL), high-density fanout, underbump metallization, bumping, and microbumps used in post-TSV processing. The Company's ALTUS systems deposit highly conformal atomic layer films for tungsten metallization applications. Pulsed Nucleation Layer (PNL), its atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology, is used in the deposition of tungsten nitride films to achieve high step coverage with reduced thickness relative to conventional barrier films. PNL is also used to reduce thickness and alter CVD bulk fill grain growth, lowering the overall resistivity of thin tungsten films. The ExtremeFill CVD tungsten technology provides extendibility to fill the structures at technology nodes. The ALTUS product family's applications include tungsten plug and via fill, 3D NAND wordlines, low-stress composite interconnects, and tungsten nitride barrier for via and contact metallization. The Company's VECTOR family of PECVD and ALD systems delivers wafer-to-wafer uniformity. VECTOR products include specialized systems for logic and memory applications with multiple platform options. VECTOR Express offers a small footprint with around four processing stations. VECTOR Excel is a modular tool for technology nodes where pre-and-post film deposition treatments are needed. VECTOR Extreme accommodates up to 12 processing stations for high-throughput applications. VECTOR Q accommodates up to 16 processing stations for depositing multi-stack films. The VECTOR product family's applications include deposition of oxides, nitrides, and carbides for hardmasks; multiple patterning films; anti-reflective layers; multi-layer stack films, and diffusion barriers. The SPEED HDP-CVD products provide void-free gap fill of dielectric films. The SPEED Product Family's applications include shallow trench isolation (STI), pre-metal dielectrics, inter-layer dielectrics, inter-metal dielectrics, and passivation layers. The SOLA ultraviolet thermal processing (UVTP) product family is used for the treatment of back-end-of-line (BEOL) low-k dielectric films and front-end-of-line (FEOL) silicon nitride strained films. The systems incorporate a treatment process that modifies the physical characteristics of a deposited film through exposure to ultraviolet light, gases and vapors, and heat. The Multi-Station Sequential Processing (MSSP) architecture allows independent control of temperature, wavelength, and intensity at each station of the wafer path. Plasma Etch The Company provides Conductor Etch, including Kiyo Product Family and Versys Metal Product Family; Dielectric Etch, such as Flex Product Family, and TSV Etch Syndion Product Family. The Kiyo product family delivers for conductor etch applications. In addition, Kiyo systems can be configured to perform atomic layer etching (ALE), which delivers atomic-scale variability control to enable wafer processing. The Kiyo Product Family's applications include FinFET gate, fin definition, STI, high-k/metal gate and multiple patterning. The Versys metal product family provides a flexible platform for BEOL metal etch processes. The Versys metal product family's applications include metal hardmask, multiple patterning, high-density aluminum line and aluminum pad. The Flex product family offers technologies and application-focused capabilities for dielectric etch applications. Its systems has in situ multi-step etch and continuous plasma capability. The Flex product family's applications include low-k and ultra low-k dual damascene, self-aligned contacts, capacitor cell, mask open, 3D NAND HAR hole, trench, and contact. Based on its production-proven conductor etch products, the Syndion TSV etch family provides flexible solutions to address multiple TSV etch applications. The Syndion products support both conventional single-step etch and rapidly alternating process (RAP). It offers Syndion Product Family for metal-oxide-semiconductor 3D IC and image sensor applications. Single-Wafer Clean The Company offers single-wafer clean during the semiconductor manufacturing process, from device fabrication through packaging. Its single-wafer clean offerings include Wet Clean, including EOS, Da Vinci, DV-Prime and SP Series, and Plasma Bevel Clean, including Coronus Product Family. It is engaged in single-wafer wet processing. Its wet clean services' applications include particle, polymer, and residue removal; photoresist removal; and wafer backside/bevel cleaning and film removal. Its wet clean systems are also used for multiple wet etch and clean applications for WLP, including silicon substrate thinning, wafer stress relief, underbump metallization etch, and photoresist removal. The Coronus plasma-based bevel clean products enhance die yield by removing particles, residues and unwanted films from the wafer's edge that can impact the device area. The Coronus Product Family's system combines the ability of plasma to selectively remove a range of materials with a confinement technology that protects the die area. The Coronus Product Family's applications include post-etch, pre- and post-deposition, pre-lithography, and metal film removal to prevent arcing during plasma etch or deposition steps. It also removes carbon-rich residues and films. Legacy Products The Company provides refurbished and newly built legacy products for semiconductor manufacturers. The Company also provides solutions for the MEMS and light emitting diode (LED) markets. The Company competes with Applied Materials, Inc., ASM International, Wonik IPS, Tokyo Electron, Ltd., Screen Holding Co., Ltd. and Semes Co., Ltd. Â» Full Overview of LRCX.OQ
