<TEXT>Computers &amp; Internet: Newly released market study: Global MEMs Microphone Market 2016-2020 Newly released market study: Global MEMs Microphone Market 2016-2020 Fast Market Research recommends Global MEMs Microphone Market 2016-2020 from TechNavio, now available [ClickPress, Thu Feb 04 2016] A MEMS microphone comprises of a pressure-sensitive diaphragm, which is fixed into a silicon IC and is accompanied by an integrated preamplifier. These devices are integrated with modern digital products, and are widely used in high-quality audio output devices. Smartphones and tablets use MEMS microphones for high-quality voice output. Optimization in technology has resulted in the development of miniaturized MEMS microphones that can be easily integrated into compact electronic products. These devices are also being used in hearing aids due to their noise-suppressing characteristic.
