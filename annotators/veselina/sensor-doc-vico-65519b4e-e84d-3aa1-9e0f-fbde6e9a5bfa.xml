<TEXT>| | | | | | Why don't vikings send emails? They prefer to use Norse code. Powered By Scannable! | | | | Here's this week's reads. Brought to you this time by Scannable! What could you do with a high quality scanning LiDAR sensor?     That's it, Enjoy! | | | | Transformations A fundamental application of electronics is transformation - from power supplies that transform AC to DC to microprocessors that transform binary code to text, graphics, and sound. While transformations at many levels may be critical to the function of a device or application, it's the high-level sensory transformations that hold the greatest potential to change the world.

What's different about this design is that all of the frequency selectivity is provided by digital filters in the digital domain and the output devices are now low voltage super bright LEDs instead of incandescent bulbs. Read It Now! | | | | | High quality LiDAR, at a price you can afford Sweep is a new scanning LiDAR sensor built from the ground up for consumer applications.  Imagine what you could do with accurate, long range depth information in your next project.  Find out more about our upcoming Kickstarter campaign and sign up for our newsletter at scannable.io | | Get More Info Advertisement | | | | | Smiley's Workshop 36 C Programming * Hardware * Projects The novice-friendly serial library was built on top of two other not so novice-friendly libraries: one for storing the data (ring buffer) and another for sending and receiving the data (USART). This episode will look at ring buffers and at another software engineering tool - the AVRStudio Simulator - that we'll use to test the ring buffer functions. Then next time, we'll look at the AVR USART.
