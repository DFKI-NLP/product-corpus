<TEXT>News Researchers Submit Patent Application, Battery Thermal Management System Including Thermal Interface Material with Integrated Heater Element, for... Politics &amp; Government Week | Thursday, 04 February 2016 18:30 (EST) Researchers Submit Patent Application, Battery Thermal Management System Including Thermal Interface Material with Integrated Heater Element, for Approval (USPTO 20160020496) By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Politics &amp; Government Week -- From Washington, D.C., VerticalNews journalists report that a patent application by the inventors Burrows, Neil Robert (White Lake Twp., MI); Chorian, Steve F. (Canton, MI); Garfinkel, George Albert (Westland, MI); Vejalla, Dhanunjay (Novi, MI); Kuo, Chung-hsing (Ann Arbor, MI), filed on July 21, 2014, was made available online on January 28, 2016. No assignee for this patent application has been made. News editors obtained the following quote from the background information supplied by the inventors: The need to reduce fuel consumption and emissions in automobiles and other vehicles is well known. Therefore, vehicles are being developed that reduce or completely eliminate reliance on an internal combustion engine. Electrified vehicles are one type of vehicle currently being developed for this purpose. In general, electrified vehicles differ from conventional motor vehicles in that they are selectively driven by one or more battery powered electric machines. Conventional motor vehicles, by contrast, rely exclusively on the internal combustion engine to drive the vehicle. Electrified vehicle batteries are typically constructed of one or more battery arrays that include a plurality of battery cells. It may be necessary to thermally manage the battery cells. For example, the battery cells may need to be cooled during some conditions or heated during other conditions. As a supplement to the background information on this patent application, VerticalNews correspondents also obtained the inventors' summary information for this patent application: A battery pack according to an example of the present disclosure includes a battery cell, a thermal interface material adjacent the battery cell and a heater element integrated with the thermal interface material. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the heater element is a resistive heater wire. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the heater element is embedded, bonded, overlaid or printed on the thermal interface material. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the heater element is contiguous with a top surface or a bottom surface of the thermal interface material. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the thermal interface material is sandwiched between the battery cell and a second battery cell. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the heater element is sandwiched between a first layer and a second layer of the thermal interface material. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the heater element is arranged in a grid that includes a plurality of heating wires arranged as a meandering loop. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the thermal interface material is wrapped around the battery cell. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the thermal interface material contacts a cold plate. A further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments includes a control system that monitors at least one temperature condition associated with the battery cell and actuates the heater element if the at least one temperature condition drops below a predefined threshold value. A battery pack according to an example of the present disclosure includes a battery array that includes a plurality of battery cells, a tray that supports the battery array, a thermal interface material between the tray and the battery array, and a heater element that heats the plurality of battery cells in response to at least one temperature condition dropping below a predefined threshold value. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the heater element is integrated with the thermal interface material. A further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments includes a second battery array adjacent to the battery array, the thermal interface material positioned between the tray and each of the battery array and the second battery array. A further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments includes a control system that includes a first sensor that monitors a first temperature condition, a second sensor that monitors a second temperature condition, and a control module that selectively actuates the heater element based on the first temperature condition and the second temperature condition. A further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments includes a cold plate positioned between the thermal interface material and the tray. A method according to an example of the present disclosure includes monitoring at least one temperature condition of a battery pack that includes a battery cell, a thermal interface material and a heater element integrated with the thermal interface material, and conditioning the battery cell with the heater element if the at least one temperature condition drops below a predefined threshold value. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the monitoring step includes sensing a first temperature condition with a first sensor, sensing a second temperature condition with a second sensor and comparing at least one of the first temperature condition and the second temperature condition to the predefined threshold value. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the first temperature condition is an ambient temperature condition and the second temperature condition is a temperature condition of the battery cell. A further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments includes ending the conditioning step once the at least one temperature condition exceeds the predefined threshold valve. In a further embodiment of any of the foregoing embodiments, the conditioning step is executed based on an estimated departure time selected by a vehicle operator. The embodiments, examples and alternatives of the preceding paragraphs, the claims, or the following description and drawings, including any of their various aspects or respective individual features, may be taken independently or in any combination. Features described in connection with one embodiment are applicable to all embodiments, unless such features are incompatible. The various features and advantages of this disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description. The drawings that accompany the detailed description can be briefly described as follows. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a powertrain of an electrified vehicle. FIG. 2 illustrates a battery pack according to a first embodiment of this disclosure. FIG. 3A illustrates a first configuration of a heater element of a battery thermal management system. FIG. 3B illustrates a second configuration of a heater element of a battery thermal management system. FIG. 3C illustrates a third configuration of a heater element of a battery thermal management system. FIG. 3D illustrates a fourth configuration of a heater element of a battery thermal management system. FIG. 4 illustrates a battery pack according to a second embodiment of this disclosure. FIG. 5 illustrates another battery pack. FIG. 6 illustrates yet another battery pack. FIG. 7 schematically illustrates an exemplary control strategy for operating a battery thermal management system.
