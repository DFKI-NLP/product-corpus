<TEXT>The Internet of Things is finding its way into a variety of travel industry businesses. Jet engine monitoring is one example of a range of consumer and back-end uses for the technology. Derin / Flickr Skift Take: Internet of Things technology is rapidly moving from a dream to practical reality for many brands in the travel industry. But the organizations that are using it tend to have massive scale and deep pockets. — Jeremy Kressman This week, we’re taking a closer look at travel brand spending on the Internet of Things. Once viewed as a pie-in-the-sky idea with few practical applications, the last two to three years have seen rapid adoption of Internet of Things technology across both customer-facing and back-end enterprise sectors of the travel industry. Airlines and airports have been quick adopters, using the technology to track passengers in terminals and monitor maintenance of jet engines.

How much did travel businesses spend on Internet of Things programs in 2015? And will many smaller brands be able to afford it? Read on below for more details, plus the rest of this week’s headlines.

However a new tool from <NODE id="2763" />Google<NODE id="2769" /> could upset this dynamic. The search company recently launched a new feature in its results to automatically display travel itinerary suggestions, restaurant picks and hotel prices. The move could further dilute referral traffic to platforms like TripAdvisor and third-party travel websites that depend on <NODE id="3076" />Google<NODE id="3082" /> for visitors.

Yet the fact is that thousands of flights each year are canceled, delayed or re-routed because of inclement weather, leading to significant passenger costs (the FAA puts the figure at $6.7 billion) along with significant anger.
