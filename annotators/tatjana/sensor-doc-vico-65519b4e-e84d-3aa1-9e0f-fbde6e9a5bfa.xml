<TEXT>| | | | | | Why don't vikings send emails? They prefer to use Norse code. Powered By <NODE id="85" />Scannable<NODE id="94" />! | | | | Here's this week's reads. Brought to you this time by <NODE id="158" />Scannable<NODE id="167" />! What could you do with a high quality<NODE id="206" /> scanning LiDAR sensor<NODE id="228" />?     That's it, Enjoy! | | | | Transformations A fundamental application of electronics is transformation - from <NODE id="342" />power supplies<NODE id="356" /> that transform AC to DC to <NODE id="384" />microprocessors<NODE id="399" /> that transform binary code to text, graphics, and sound. While transformations at many levels may be critical to the function of a device or application, it's the high-level sensory transformations that hold the greatest potential to change the world.

These are the sounds of The Flying Marbellos - a rolling ball sculpture with marbles and small metal bugs to run the Stamp controlled show. Read It Now! | | | | | Psychedelia II  This color organ has both hardware and software (firmware) components. What's different about this design is that all of the frequency selectivity is provided by digital filters in the digital domain and the output devices are now low voltage super bright LEDs instead of incandescent bulbs.

This episode will look at ring buffers and at another software engineering tool - the <NODE id="1934" />AVRStudio<NODE id="1943" /> Simulator<NODE id="1953" /> - that we'll use to test the ring buffer functions. Then next time, we'll look at the <NODE id="2040" />AVR<NODE id="2043" /> USART<NODE id="2049" />.
