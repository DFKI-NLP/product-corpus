CHARLOTTE, N.C.
Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory is taking an expanded role on <NODE id="271" />Charlotte's airwaves<NODE id="291" /> after a <NODE id="300" />radio station<NODE id="313" /> manager says his recent daily segments got an "extraordinary" response.
The former Republican governor and <NODE id="421" />WBT radio<NODE id="430" /> personality Bo Thompson are now co-hosting a one-hour show weekday mornings. McCrory started doing early-morning spots on Thompson's other program in September, talking about the city's mayoral race and other current events.
<NODE id="656" />WBT<NODE id="659" /> general manager Matt Hanlon tells The <NODE id="698" />Charlotte Observer<NODE id="716" /> that appearances by the ex-Charlotte mayor helped boost ratings and provided lots of feedback. The <NODE id="816" />newspaper<NODE id="825" /> says McCrory agreed after the November election to the new time slot for at least a couple of months.
McCrory narrowly lost to Democrat Roy Cooper last year. He hasn't ruled out running again for governor in 2020.
