Fashion Flash Giveaway with <NODE id="104" />Peace &amp; Love<NODE id="116" /> <NODE id="117" />necklaces<NODE id="126" />
November 21, 2017
<NODE id="145" />Fashion Flash<NODE id="158" />, our weekly emagazine, often hosts giveaways on the blogs that are part of this great group. This time it’s a romantic giveaway and it’s Beauty Info Zone’s turn. This is a two prong giveaway with a romance novel by a <NODE id="376" />New York Times<NODE id="390" /> bestselling author and a necklace from Nancy Davis, owner of <NODE id="452" />Peace &amp; Love <NODE id="465" />jewelry<NODE id="472" />. Each of the two winners will receive two prizes that I’m sure will make your heart happy.
Part 1 of the giveaway is a paperback novel by Elizabeth Hoyt, <NODE id="627" />Wicked Intentions<NODE id="644" /> .
<NODE id="647" />Wicked Intentions<NODE id="664" /> by Elizabeth Hoyt
From the <NODE id="692" />New York Times<NODE id="706" /> bestselling author Elizabeth Hoyt comes the first book in her beloved Maiden Lane series.
A MAN CONTROLLED BY HIS DESIRES . . .
Infamous for his wild, sensual needs, Lazarus Huntington, Lord Caire, is searching for a savage killer in St. Giles, London’s most notorious slum. Widowed Temperance Dews knows St. Giles like the back of her hand-she’s spent a lifetime caring for its inhabitants at the foundling home her family established. Now that home is at risk . . .
A WOMAN HAUNTED BY HER PAST . . .
Caire makes a simple offer-in return for Temperance’s help navigating the perilous alleys of St. Giles, he will introduce her to London’s high society so that she can find a benefactor for the home. But Temperance may not be the innocent she seems, and what begins as cold calculation soon falls prey to a passion that neither can control-one that may well destroy them both.
A BARGAIN NEITHER COULD REFUSE
This is the first book in her 11 book Maiden Lane series and earned 4.5 stars from <NODE id="1699" />Romantic Times Book Reviews<NODE id="1726" />. It might just start you off on a journey you won’t want to end.
Part 2 is a <NODE id="1804" />necklace<NODE id="1812" /> from the wonderful <NODE id="1832" />Peace and Love<NODE id="1846" /> collection by Nancy Davis. As you are reading this the necklaces aren’t even available but you will have the chance to win one of these Black Friday specials in our giveaway.
<NODE id="2022" />Peace &amp; Love<NODE id="2034" /> Legacy Sterling Silver White Zircon Charm Pendant w/ 16″ Chain<NODE id="2097" />
Nancy Davis is going to be on <NODE id="2128" />EVINE<NODE id="2133" /> to share her jewelry on Thursday 11/23 11 p.m. to midnight, and again on Black Friday 11/24 from midnight to 1 a.m, 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. (when the variety of necklaces will be shown), 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. with these necklaces and again from 1 to 2 p.m. and 10 to 11 p.m. Her collection of 16 necklaces will be available on <NODE id="2451" />Evine<NODE id="2456" /> all day for the terrific price of $29.99 (normally priced at $55).
I have 2 to give away out of the 16 but I’d still advise you to check these out on <NODE id="2607" />Evine<NODE id="2612" /> since they will make fabulous gifts. They come ready for gift giving in their colorful box so all you need is a bow and a gift card.
These have a 16″ inch chain with a 2″ extender. The chain itself is Sterling Silver while the stones are White Zircon and look like diamonds.
