New York, NY -- ( SBWIRE ) -- 10/20/2017 -- In the minimally invasive surgeries, small incisions are made on the body. A laparoscope is inserted through one of the incisions or openings to serve as a guide during the surgery. A laparoscope is a tube like instrument that has a lens and a light for viewing. Also, tiny surgical instruments are inserted through other openings in order to undertake the surgery. The advantages of minimally invasive surgeries are that no large cuts are made in the body, there is a lower risk of infection and the recovery period from the surgery is also shorter. One of the main advantages of minimally invasive surgeries is the reduced amount of money that is spend on such kind of surgery as compared with traditional surgeries. Also, with the continuous technological innovations in the field of minimally invasive surgeries, such type of surgeries are getting more popular around the world. However, it needs to be noted that minimally invasive surgery is not suitable for all types of patients due to factors such as high body mass index, adhesions on the skin and other medical conditions. Moreover, minimally invasive surgery can lead to complications like infection, bleeding, anesthesia and injury to organs.
