Emerging technologies in the form of advanced metal detectors, improved baggage scanners and robust explosive detection system are expected to drive the market as these technologies helps in easy detection of unwanted and illegal materials in different modes of transportation. Total airport security system is a relatively new concept and is undergoing extensive research. The system uses multi-level surveillance and intelligence system which will scan the entire airport and provide real-time data to the security experts. Data from various real-time sensors and sub systems would be analyzed on a real-time basis through a situational analysis. This information will then be shared with the security personnel on a continuous basis and used for the purpose of neutralizing any threats. Thus, installation of this new security system at an effective cost without compromising on the quality is expected to offer a huge potential for the transportation and security system market during the forecast period. Key players profiled in this report include Alstom S.A. (France), Honeywell International (U.S.), Kapsch Group (Austria), L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc (U.S.), Lockheed Martin (U.S.) and Orbcomm Inc (U.S.) among others.
