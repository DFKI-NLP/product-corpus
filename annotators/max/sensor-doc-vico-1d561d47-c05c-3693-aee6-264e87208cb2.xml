<TEXT>Fiber Optic Connectors Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2015 - 2021 NEW YORK, Jan. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Fiber optic connectors (FOC) are used to mechanically connect two optical fibers, thereby permitting light to transmit from the core of one particular fiber to the other fiber in order to link the fiber optic connection equipment. The global fiber optic connectors market has been segmented on the basis of types and applications. A cross sectional analysis of the global fiber optic connectors market broadly across five geographical segments has also been covered under the scope this report. The factors which are primarily driving the growth of the global fiber optic connectors market are increasing demand for high bandwidth in the telecommunication industry and increasing demand for transmission speed and data volume in the data centers. The key features of fiber optical connectors such as low power consumption, cost effectiveness and high data transmission among others. These features are expected to fuel the growth of fiber optics connectors in the next generation warehouse-scale data center networks. In addition, the increasing application of these connectors in medical sector is playing a significant role in pushing the growth of the market. Furthermore, large scale production and technological advancements of fiber optics is also driving the growth of the global market. The conjoint effect of all these drivers is therefore set to bolster the growth of the global fiber optic connectors market during the forecast period from 2015-2021. The rapid growth of the internet and cloud computing has resulted in bandwidth requirements for data center network. This is in turn expected to increase the demand for optical interconnects in the next-generation data center networks. Furthermore, advancements in fiber optic technology have led to the growth in requirement for <NODE id="1943" />optical sensors<NODE id="1958" /> and data links in several applications including defense and aerospace. By deploying the advanced technologies in this field, the manufacturers can utilize this opportunity to increase production in a cost-effective manner as well as satiate the growing demand for fiber optic components among consumers. However, phenomenal growth in the wireless networking system is hampering the advancement of fiber optics. Moreover, the high cost and low level of automation of fiber optic connectors might also restrict the growth of the global market.
