<TEXT>59 Global Photoresists and Photoresist Ancillaries Market is Expected to Reach US$ 4.60 Bn in 2020 Photoresists Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2014 – 2020 Photoresists are light-sensitive materials that are primarily used in fabrication and packaging of <NODE id="300" />semiconductors<NODE id="314" />, <NODE id="316" />integrated circuits<NODE id="335" />, <NODE id="337" />flat panel displays<NODE id="356" /> and <NODE id="361" />printed circuit boards<NODE id="383" />. Photoresists play an important role in photolithography and photo-patterning process. Photoresists consist of resin or polymer, solvent and photo-sensitizer. These are segmented into positive and negative photoresists based on developing option. Photoresists are applied on the surface of a <NODE id="676" />wafer<NODE id="681" /> and further exposed to light of pre-determined wavelength. Photoresist ancillaries are supporting materials that are used to improve the efficiency and resolution of the photolithography process. These are used right from the start of the process such as adhesion promotion of photoresists to wafer substrate in order to develop photoresists to remove excessive photoresists after the developer treatment. Browse The Full <NODE id="1104" />Market Report<NODE id="1117" /> , Here : http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/photoresist-chemicals-market.html Growth in <NODE id="1213" />semiconductor<NODE id="1226" /> industry and dynamic <NODE id="1248" />flat panel display<NODE id="1266" /> technology trends are expected to be the major driving factors for growth of the photoresists and photoresist ancillaries market. However, environmental and occupational health hazards associated with photoresists and photoresist ancillaries component is expected to hamper market growth.
