          <NODE id="71" />CONSOL Energy Inc.<NODE id="89" /> began placing mine map                           materials at the Archives of the University of                           Pittsburgh in 1991. The                               <NODE id="266" />CONSOL Energy Inc.<NODE id="284" /> Mine Maps and Records                             Collection has grown to include over                           8,000 individual map sheets relating to mines                           once operated by the <NODE id="491" />CONSOL Energy<NODE id="504" /> subsidiary                           <NODE id="542" />Consolidation Coal Company<NODE id="568" />.

           The project focuses on a subset of the                           collection called hardback maps.  The                           term "hardback" refers to the map's                           construction of heavyweight paper adhered to                           canvas backing.  The over-sized                           dimensions of the maps (5 ft. tall and up to                           30 ft. long) present challenges in use and                           preservation.  The hardback maps served                           as master copies and often contain the most                           complete diagram of underground mines owned                           and/or operated by <NODE id="1328" />Consolidated Coal Company<NODE id="1353" /> and its constituents in the Pennsylvania                           counties of Allegheny, Westmoreland,                           Washington, Greene, Fayette, and                           Somerset. 
           The project is supported by a partnership in                           funding among the Pennsylvania Dept. of                           Environmental Protection ( PA-DEP ), the                                U.S. Dept. of the Interior Office of Surface                           Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement ( OSMRE ), the                           University Library System ( ULS )                           of the University of Pittsburgh and <NODE id="2018" />CONSOL                             Energy<NODE id="2059" /> .  The hardback maps are surveyed , cleaned                           and repaired at                           the ULS Preservation Dept.  Once                           stabilized, the maps are transported to the                           OSMRE National Mine Map Repository ( NMMR )                           where they are cataloged and digitized .  The digital images are transferred to the                           PA-DEP California District Office for                           geo-referencing and use in GIS                           applications.  Lastly, the physical maps return to the University of Pittsburgh for                           long-term archival storage.  The ULS                           Preservation Dept. began stabilizing maps for                           scanning in June, 2007.
