Brought to you this time by <NODE id="158" />Scannable!<NODE id="168" /> What could you do with a high quality scanning <NODE id="216" />LiDAR sensor<NODE id="228" />?     That's it, Enjoy! | | | | Transformations A fundamental application of electronics is transformation - from power supplies that transform AC to DC to microprocessors that transform binary code to text, graphics, and sound. While transformations at many levels may be critical to the function of a device or application, it's the high-level sensory transformations that hold the greatest potential to change the world.

What's different about this design is that all of the frequency selectivity is provided by digital filters in the digital domain and the output devices are now low voltage super bright <NODE id="1166" />LEDs<NODE id="1170" /> instead of incandescent bulbs.

This episode will look at ring buffers and at another software engineering tool - the <NODE id="1934" />AVRStudio Simulator<NODE id="1953" /> - that we'll use to test the ring buffer functions. Then next time, we'll look at the <NODE id="2040" />AVR USART<NODE id="2049" />.
